# Chuck Norris App

## Running the project
* Clone the project
* Install the dependencies: `npm i`
* Run the app: `npm start`

* Running tests: `npm run test`

## Gotcha
* I've used the 'product' naming but in this context (using chuck norris api), a 'product' is a 'joke' and 'products' are the 'joke categories'.

Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
